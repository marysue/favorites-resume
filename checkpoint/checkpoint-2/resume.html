          <p>Having a broad background in software engineering, starting as a Unix Systems Administrator, moving
		  into Software Development has allowed me to quickly assimilate into complex environments quickly.</p>
		  
		  <p>Having graduated from San Francisco State University, I spent  4 years programming 
		  in c and C++ in the gnu-unix and Visual Studio environments in financial systems and medical
		  device enterprise development organizations.</p>
		  
		  <p>After taking a 12 year sabatical to raise my family, I returned to software engineering. 
		  First, working customer support and technical assistance at an Internet Service Provider 
		  installing security certificates and websites in Microsoft IIS/Apache-Tomcat environments.</p>
		  
		  <p>Recently, I worked for an educational services provider, providing customized citrix virtual 
		  environments, installing gateways, routers, domains, and desktops in both the Linux and Microsoft
		  O/S's.</p>

		  <p>The final two years I moved into full-time development on an Agile development team working 
		  with Object Oriented programming.  I developed software within a pre-designed framework, 
		  expanding and maintaining code in Java.  Although having such versatility on the job was interesting,
		  focusing on full-stack engineering was where I thrived.  It was the perfect combination of using my 
		  past experience working with SQL, and c-based languages, but incorporated the front-end technologies 
		  HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JSP, JUnit, and XML.</p>
